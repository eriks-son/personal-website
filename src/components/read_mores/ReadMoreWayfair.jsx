                During the end of my co-op at Wayfair, I discovered an issue in our filtering library. This was used not just by our team but about half a dozen surrounding teams as well.

                Despite only having a few weeks left at the company, the problem’s complexity grabbed my interest and I kept going back to work on it after finishing my assigned work. Due to the amount of teams that used the library, there were two completely different codebase implementations meaning I had to not only learn how it works for my team but for teams with entirely different codebases.

                I had spent around a week testing different solutions when I was flying to see family in Sweden. Despite this, I spent every second between getting my Dunkin breakfast sandwich “dinner” and boarding as well as a few hours on the flight engrossed with no WiFi and only the documentation I had pulled up before taking off, until I finally found the solution. I closed my laptop and looked out the window just in time to faintly see the northern lights for the first time:
