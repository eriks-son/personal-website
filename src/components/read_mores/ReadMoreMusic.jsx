                As shown below, I've been fortunate enough to play drums for and open for some incredibly talented artists. I've had the chance to play shows and festivals at multiple universities across the country. I've also had the chance to record drums and otherwise work on songs from these artists. The songs that I've currently played on are shown below and there are a few more in the works that I hope I can add to that list soon! Here is a picture from when I was able to open for Beach Bunny and Boyish with Michele Leigh:
